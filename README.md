## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

To set up the environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# install Poetry (skip if you already have it)
pip install poetry

# clone the repo and enter it
git clone https://github.com/Gringham/CROC.git
cd CROC

# tell Poetry to use whatever python3 you have handy
poetry env use $(which python3)

# resolve & install everything declared in pyproject.toml / poetry.lock
poetry install --no-interaction --sync

```
Note that some parts of CROC have conflicting dependencies and require different environment.s
