# CROC <br><sub><sup>CROC: Evaluating and Training T2I Metrics with Pseudo- and Human-Labeled Contrastive Robustness Checks</sup></sub>

In this repository, we release the source code of our dataset CROC and the metric CROCScore. For usage instructions, please see the respective folder's readme files, as well as the main part of the scripts and comments in the code. In the coming days we will upload all parts of the code step-by-step.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

To set up the environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# install Poetry (skip if you already have it)
pip install poetry

# clone the repo and enter it
git clone https://github.com/Gringham/CROC.git
cd CROC

# tell Poetry to use whatever python3 you have handy
poetry env use $(which python3)

# resolve & install everything declared in pyproject.toml / poetry.lock
poetry install --no-interaction --sync

```
Note that some parts of CROC have conflicting dependencies and require different environment.s
