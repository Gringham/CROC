# Webserver

Here we add the webserver definition that we use for our annotation campaign, which was created iteratively with GPT-5 support. For running it on a server, we used Nginx on a Google Cloud VM. 

```
app/main.py - runs the webpage defined in index.html
web/index.html - contains our annotation guidelines
```
