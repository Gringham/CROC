STABLE DIFFUSION PROMPTING GUIDE START
1. Introduction to Prompting

Stable Diffusion 3.5 generates images from text prompts. A prompt typically includes:

Subject, Adjectives, Artistic Style, Additional Context

- Comma-separated: This structure helps the model parse each concept clearly.
- Clarity & Detail: The more specific you are, the more targeted your results.
- Context: Adding references to style, era, or environment helps guide the model toward your vision.

2. Basic Prompt Structure

A simple, concise prompt often follows this pattern:

[Subject/Concept], [Description], [Artistic Style], [Additional Context]

Example:

A bright futuristic city, neon-lit, digital art style, at night

- Subject: “A bright futuristic city”
- Description: “neon-lit”
- Artistic Style: “digital art style”
- Context: “at night”

3. Getting Started: Simple Prompts

For a quick test, keep your prompt short and direct:

A beautiful forest at sunrise

- This yields a forest scene lit by morning sunlight.
- To refine, add more descriptors: “misty,” “enchanted,” “warm glow.”

Tip: Start with a basic prompt, evaluate the result, and then iterate by adding or removing keywords.

4. Descriptive Language and Keyword Selection

4.1 Descriptive Adjectives
Use adjectives that define color, mood, texture, or style:

- Style: “steampunk,” “baroque,” “hyperrealistic”

4.2 Synonyms and Variations

- “no text,” “no watermark,” “not red”

5. Styling Your Output

5.1 Art Styles and Mediums
Referencing known styles or mediums can heavily influence the output:
- “oil painting,” “watercolor,” “3D rendering,” “pixel art,” “impressionist”
