* Original generated prompts are saved in outputs/core_prompts.json
* These can be used with the slurm script img_gen_core.sh to generate the respective images (for stable diffusion and flux)
* Note that we manually alter some prompts in the final selection of images (outputs/selected_paths contains prompt-image mapping) to reduce ambiguity (e.g. removing unclear adjectives)
